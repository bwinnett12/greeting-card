#Greeting Card

Hello.
This is a little thing I use as my message of the day for when I log in. Currently, it only shows [the poem of the day](https://github.com/bwinnett12/poetress) but that very well could and will change.

To set it up.... Simply you need to have ruby and bundle installed. Then run this command from the Greeting card directory
```
./setup.sh
```
